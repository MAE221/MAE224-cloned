# Introduction
MAE 224 is the Integrate Science Lab...

##Prequisites

### Python
If you want to run the Python code make sure that you have the most up-to-date version of Python 2.7.x.
Furthermore, if you wish to be able to flash local code to the Particle Photon, you will need to install the requests module.
This can be done by simply entering

```
pip install requests
```
into the terminal

###Matlab
The Matlab code has been designed to utilize the latest version of Matlab (currently 2016a). Matlab does not support HTML PUT requests. Currently, Matlab will call cURL from a unix terminal to upload local code. This functionality will be added in later editions.
