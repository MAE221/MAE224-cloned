//It would be prudent to include serial output to help debug
//I've gotten you started with a variable voltage which will be the value we wish to output
double voltage = 0.0

void setup()
{
  // Register a Spark variable here

  // Connect the pressure sensor to A0 and configure it
  // to be an input

  /EXTRA - Enable serial output if you wish
}

void loop()
{
//Measure the analog input from A0 (0-4095) and compute to voltage  (0-3.3V)

//EXTRA- You can take advantage of the fact that the spark core is sampling faster than the server and average several measurements together
